    <p>Hi! My name is Anthony and I am a senior at Lawndale High School. My favorite things to do are go out with friends and play soccer. I am currently on the varsity soccer team at Lawndale and I have been playing club soccer for 7 years. I am 17 years old and I plan on being a firefighter after college.</p>
